//Create a sum method in your class which takes a List of integers as parameter
//It should return the sum of the elements in the list
//Follow these steps:
//Create an xUnit project
//Add a Test class to your project
//Add a new Test case in it
//Instantiate your class (arrange, act, assert)
//create a list of integers
//use the Assert.Equal() to test the result of the created sum method
//Run them
//Create different tests where you test your method with:
//an empty list
//a list that has one element in it
//a list that has multiple elements in it
//a null
//Run them
//Fix your code if needed
