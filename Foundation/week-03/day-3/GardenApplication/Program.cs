//The task is to create a garden application, so in your main method you should create a garden with flowers and trees.
//The program should demonstrate an example garden with two flowers (yellow and blue) and two trees (purple and orange).
//After creating these plants you should show the user how the garden looks like.
//After that the program should water the garden twice, first with the amount of 40 then with 70.
//After every watering the user should see the state of the garden as you can see in the output below:

//The yellow Flower needs water
//The blue Flower needs water
//The purple Tree needs water
//The orange Tree needs water

//Watering with 40
//The yellow Flower doesnt need water
//The blue Flower doesnt need water
//The purple Tree needs water
//The orange Tree needs water

//Watering with 70
//The yellow Flower doesn't need water
//The blue Flower doesn't need water
//The purple Tree doesn't need water
//The orange Tree doesn't need water
